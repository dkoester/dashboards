# available-parking

### Overview
This dashboard collection is meant to visualize the data stored in influxDB from hitting the *surepark-api* [here](https://github.com/mspmac/surepark-api) `/waittimedisplays` endpoint. Right now there are only one set of gauges and one graph. In the future, other data might be also shown on this dashboard to try and visualize parking as they associate with flights.
