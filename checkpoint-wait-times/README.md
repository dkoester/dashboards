# Checkpoint-wait-times

### Overview
This dashboard collection is meant to visualize the data stored in influxDB from hitting the secutiry-checkpoint-api `/waittimedisplays` endpoint. Right now there are only one set of guages and one graph. In the future, flight data might be also shown on this dashboard to try and visualize wait times as they associate with flights.
